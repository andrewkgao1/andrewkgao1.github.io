# Academics

I am a sophomore student majoring in Physics at Peking University. I have participated in research on **convective computation** and **radiative transfer**. For more details, please visit [Research](https://andrewkgao1.github.io/research). 

# Activities

### Soccer

I play as right fullback and midfielder for Yuanpei College in Peking University's intramural soccer cup. We won second place in the Peking University Cup in 2021.

### Photography

I enjoy photography, especially astronomy photography. I like to take photos of stars in unconventional places to encourage people to look up at the heavens, no matter where they are.

### Volunteering

I have volunteered at Beijing Planetarium to narrate the exhibits for tourists from 2014 to 2019. I find it satisfying to convey my knowledge on astronomy to young and old visitors alike.
