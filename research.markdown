#### Bartlett, S., **A. Gao**, and Y. L. Yung, Computation by Convective Logic Gates and Thermal Communication (in press, Artificial Life Journal)


We demonstrate a novel computational architecture based on fluid convection logic gates and heat flux-mediated information flows. Our previous work demonstrated that Boolean logic operations can be performed by thermally-driven convection flows. In this work, we use numerical simulations to demonstrate a different, but universal Boolean logic operation (NOR), performed by simpler convective gates. The gates in the present work do not rely on obstacle flows or periodic boundary conditions, a significant improvement in terms of experimental realizability. Conductive heat transfer links can be used to connect the convective gates, and we demonstrate this with the example of binary half addition. These simulated circuits could be constructed in an experimental setting with modern, 2-dimensional fluidics equipment, such as a thin layer of fluid between acrylic plates. The presented approach thus introduces a new realm of unconventional, thermal fluid-based computation.My contribution: I designed and tested the logic gates, and participated in creating the NOR gate, as well as creating the half-adder.

#### Natraj, V., R. J. D. Spurr, **A. Gao**, T. Le, Z.-C. Zeng, S. Fan, and Y. L. Yung, The Two-Stream -Exact Single Scattering (2S-ESS) Radiative Transfer Model, To be submitted in Mar 2022.


The two-stream approximation is a popular approach for the calculation of fluxes and heating rates. However, it is typically not accurate enough for remote sensing applications involving analysis of spectral radiances. We present the two-stream-exact single scattering (2S-ESS) radiative transfer model, which performs an exact calculation of single scattering using an accurate treatment of the phase function, while approximating multiple scattering with the two-stream approach. We examine the accuracy of this model for slab and multi-layer scenarios. The results show that this methodology introduces errors of less than a few percent in most situations, with the exception of extremely heavy aerosol or cloud loading events. The code is publicly available along with documentation and test cases to assist the user.



My contribution: I optimized the code for the new method, and I also performed tests to compare the results of our method with DISORT results to gauge the capabilities and limits of the method.
